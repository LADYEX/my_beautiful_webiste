## Our Story

Women for Women is a network connecting and supporting (future) female leaders. We are driven by the belief that women grow by empowering each other.

We are driven by the belief that women grow by empowering each other. We support women, who do not have a network yet with planning their long-term goals, achieving their ambitions, finding great opportunities and being ready when they arise.

For female students, Women for Women is the female mentorship network that is the organisation for creating successful long-term relationships to achieve the mentee's long-term goals because we care about persolanized matching and fostering a great community.

## My Role

I am Head of Community, responsible to connect the mentees and mentors with each other, building long-term and sustainable connections.
