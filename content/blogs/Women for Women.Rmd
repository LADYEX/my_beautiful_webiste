## Our Story
***

Women for Women is a female network connecting and supporting (future) female leaders. We are driven by the belief that women grow by empowering each other. We offer women a network that supports them planning their long-term goals, achieving their ambitions, finding great opportunities and backs them when they arise.


## My Role
***

I am Head of Community, responsible for our community. Our goal is to nurture our growing community by building long-term and sustainable connections among mentees and mentors through workshops, speeches, casual get-togethers and other events.
