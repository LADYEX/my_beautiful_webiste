## About ISC Alumni
***
As the alumni organization of the International Students' Committee (ISC), we provide a platform to promote bonding and sharing of experiences among ISC alumni, to foster connections among the different generations of ISC, and to advance the ISC. We organise speaker series, workshops, casual get-togethers and much more.

The ISC is the yearly changing organising committee of the St. Gallen Symposium, an international two-day conference taking place at the University of St. Gallen (Switzerland) in May. Every year key decision-makers from the fields of economics, politics, science, and society take part in the symposium to meet and exchange with the next generation of leaders. The entire conference is organised by the International Students' Committee. It's a Team of 35 students from the University of St. Gallen who pause their studies for 10 months to engage in the realization of an inter-generational dialogue.
