<h2>Omega Group plc - Pay Discrimination</h2>
<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>The following analysis shows whether there is a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<p>By conducting this t-test, it can be concluded that the null hypothesis can be rejected at 95% confidence level as the p-value is less than 0.05. We can conclude that there is a significant difference between the population means of salaries of males and females.</p>

<h2>Relationship Experience - Gender?</h2>
<p>At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).</p>

<p>We observe that the mean experience of males is greater than that of females, and the confidence intervals for both genders are not overlapping. The p value of t test is 1e-05. Therefore, we can conclude that the population means of years of experience of males and females are statistically not the same at 95% confidence level. This conclusion endangers our previous one about the difference in male and female salaries. The difference in salary may be due to the difference in experience.</p>

<h2>Relationship Salary - Experience ?</h2>
<p>Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.</p>
<p>The following analysis the relationship between salary and experience.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>omega %&gt;%

  labs(title = &quot;Scatterplot between Salary and Experience&quot;,

<h2>Check correlations between the data</h2>

<p><img src="/projects/homework3_files/figure-html/ggpairs-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can observe that salary and work experience are positively correlated. As the number of years of work experience increase, salary increases on average. This relation holds true for males as well as females. However, many women executives have experience less than 5 years and several even have zero year. This means Omega just started to promote women in the previous years, while experience of men executives are more evenly distributed.</p>
