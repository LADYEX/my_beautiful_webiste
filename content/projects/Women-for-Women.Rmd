## Our Story
***
Women for Women (W4W) is a female network connecting (future) female leaders. We are driven by the belief that women grow by empowering each other. W4W offers women a network that supports them planning their long-term goals, achieving their ambitions, finding great opportunities and backs them when they arise.


## My Role
***
I am Head of Community, responsible for nurturing our growing community by building long-term and sustainable connections among mentees and mentors through workshops, speeches, casual gatherings and other events.


## What we offer
***
- Resources for industries, jobs, application processes, exchange semesters
- Access to women from all over Europe with diverse backgrounds, roles and interests
- Through our mentoring program you will be able to form meaningful, long-lasting relationships with other women
